# Generic EasyStar mixer

# The EasyStar is a basic trainer with rudder, elevator and throttle.
# In this simplest possible mixer, some of the available inputs are connected direct to the outputs.
# Since there are no ailerons, the rudder is attached to the Roll input rather than the Yaw input for this model.

{
   output[0] = input{Roll};
   output[1] = input{Pitch};
   output[2] = input{Throttle};
