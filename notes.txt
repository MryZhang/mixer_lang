Add Inputs
   input[NAME]
   a map (or simple list of) inputs
   inputs can be variable or constant and can have a type of float/int/bool
   Inputs will map in ArduPlane to [ pitch, roll, yaw, throttle] etc
   These will be considered to be variables.

   Also use ArduPlane params. 
   They can be looked up by name using AP_Param::find(name,type)
   These inputs will be considered to be constants.

Add functions
    functions to start will be predefined only. 
    e.g.
      min(a,b) 
      max(a,b)
      constrain(val, minval,maxval)
      float(v) # cast ( casts must be explicit)
      int(v)   # cast
      bool(v)  # cast
      sin(alpha)
      cos(alpha)
      tan(alpha)
      if(cond,true_expr,false_expr)
